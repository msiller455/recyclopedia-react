## How It Works

Users create a profile and sign in. Users can create events to organize a group to meet up and clean a beach or park. Users can search other users and their event, or a list of all events. Users can delete their profile or logout.

## California Coastal Commission API

Cali|Ocial uses data from the California Coastal Commission API. It gathers county and site name and location data from the API and populates forms on the 'Create Event Page' for users to select locations to clean up.

## Future Plans and Unimplemented Ideas
* Ability to join other users' events
* Friends feature
* Profile Pictures
* Comments on events
* Dates and notifcations for upcoming events
